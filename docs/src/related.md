# Related open-source packages

The following open-source packages provide similar or even extended functionality as
`LinearMaps.jl`.

*   [`Spot`: A linear-operator toolbox for Matlab](https://github.com/mpf/spot),
    which seems to have heavily inspired the Julia package
    [`LinearOperators.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/LinearOperators.jl)
    and the Python package [`PyLops`](https://github.com/equinor/pylops)
*   [`fastmat`: fast linear transforms in Python](https://pypi.org/project/fastmat/)

*   [`FunctionOperators.jl`](https://github.com/hakkelt/FunctionOperators.jl)
    and [`LinearMapsAA.jl`](https://github.com/JeffFessler/LinearMapsAA.jl)
    also support mappings between `Array`s, inspired by the `fatrix` object type in the
    [Matlab version of the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox (MIRT)](https://github.com/JeffFessler/mirt).
